        <h1>Kanae</h1>
        <p>Kanae (叶) is a male Japanese Virtual YouTuber and a member of NIJISANJI. Previously, he was a founding member of the now-dissolved group, NIJISANJI Gamers, along with Akabane Youko.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <p>A young man with a healing presence and a fluffy, sweet way of speaking that can wash you away. He suddenly descended like an angel as he holds a cat cushion in his arms.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <p>Kanae is a self-assured, charming individual who is one of the most popular members of NIJISANJI.</p>
        <p>His popularity can be owed to his sociable personality. He is particularly good at improv and can create witty responses to conversations often. His easy-going and friendly nature allows him to hold conversations effortlessly with others, giving him a wide social circle where he often collaborates with professional gamers, Utaites, mangakas, seiyuus and NIJISANJI International members (despite the language barrier).</p>
        <p>Because of this, Kanae has been described to have 'Predator'-level communication skills (a reference to the highest rank in the game APEX Legends, means to have amazing communication skills). He is very transparent with his thoughts and feelings, and often opens up to his viewers. He rarely loses his cool demeanor or raises his voice.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, he is also known as mischievous individual, often purposefully aggravating his fellow streamers with sarcastic jokes and actions. The saying "Kanae lies as he breathes" is a statement thrown out a lot in Kanae's fandom, for he's well known for lying very nonchalantly .</p>
		<p>Other livers even said that Kanae is a mysterious individual, a person who they can not be read very easily. Despite this, Kanae is truthfully a very caring person who speaks highly of his friends at any chance and tries to improve himself as much as possible. He once comforted Yuuki Chihiro, calmly explaining and consoling her when she cried on stream.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>Kanae has flowy ash-brown hair that has differing lengths on different avatars. He has very light tower-gray droopy eyes with a small mole under his left eye and has worn multiple differently styled clothes.</p>
        <p>In his original outfit, his indoor pajama outfit, Kanae has his hair styled in a fluffy bob cut with bangs and a white hairpin on his left side-bangs. He wears a black turtleneck sweater under his mint-blue hoodie paired with brown and white striped sweatpants. He wears all of this with his orange and white slippers that have animal paw designs on the soles.</p>
		  <p>In his second regular outfit, his street wear outfit, Kanae has his hair styled in either a fluffy short bob cut with bangs and a black hairpin on his left side-bangs or a longer low-ponytail hairstyle with his left side-bangs tucked behind his left ear that has two black ear-cuffs on the helix and a black stud on his lobe. He wears an over-sized dark-gray cardigan with white pocket linings atop a light-gray knitted turtleneck sweater. He accessorizes it with a silver necklace and puts two hairpins on his jacket. He wears wide-legged harem pants with ribbons on the side and leggings underneath. All of this is paired with black combat boots.</p>
		  <p>In his third regular outfit, his white casual outfit, Kanae has short hair with a wavy parted fringe showing a bit of his hairline and his left ear which has a silver dangling earring. He wears a long white bishop sleeved button-up shirt below an off-white sweater vest paired with black skinny trousers and a pair of black oxford dress shoes. Roto would also sometimes appear on top of his head.</p>
		  <p>In his current main outfit, Kanae has his hair styled in a high ponytail with his bangs being swept to the left while the rest of his hair is tucked behind his right ear which has a black studded earring. He wears a long sleeved black button up shirt with bluish grey flower prints along with black skinny trousers and a pair of black oxford shoes. The sleeves on this outfit are rolled up to his elbows. He has a dangling black bracelet on his right wrist accompanying a black ring on his thumb. On his left hand, a black ring is seen on his index finger while there are 2 also black rings on is middle finger. His nails are painted also black. Looking closely, theres a chain bracelet at his ankles. Plus, there are fashionable loose ribbons on the left side of his shirt near his hips.</p>
