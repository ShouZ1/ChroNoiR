        <h1>Kuzuha</h1>
        <p>Kuzuha (葛葉) is a male Japanese Virtual YouTuber and a member of NIJISANJI. Previously, he was an independent VTuber and later a member of NIJISANJI Gamers' third batch along with Makaino Ririmu, Shiina Yuika, and Setsuna (known as "ZuShiRi" after Setsuna's graduation). He is currently the second most subscribed male VTuber worldwide, with over 1.70 million subscribers on YouTube</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <p>A NEET gamer vampire that continues to leech off his parents' wealth.[4] Despite his appearance, he has a selfish, fickle and childish personality, and has a bad habit of getting carried away. In addition, he's a hopeless. cash-strapped vampire who is hungry for money.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <p>Despite initially debuting as a reserved and suave vampire, the current Kuzuha is a loud-mouth and entertaining individual. He is very expressive when playing games, often shouting or boasting his own genius. He has a characteristic drawl and casual way of speaking which is often parodied by other livers. He is quick to become jokingly aggressive and confrontational to fellow livers, and often says or tweets off-beat things.</p>
        <p>However when collabing with other livers he is known to be infamously shy and awkward. His first collaboration with Sakura Ritsuki sparked the birth of what is known as his "Weather Deck", where he attempts to start a conversation by asking about the weather. Though after some time, these collaborations would get more chaotic and less awkward as he gets closer to them. Kuzuha would also sometimes give valuable life advice to his viewers. Truthfully, he seems to be a hesitant and modest individual; he often talks about his uncertainty in his own skills and working towards improving himself.</p>
        <p>Kuzuha is perceptive to the feelings of others and can easily read the room. He once comforted Yuuki Chihiro in his own way when she cried on stream.</p>
        <p>Despite being a vampire, he easily gets scared when playing horror games and would always try to stall for as much as possible if given the chance.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>Kuzuha has striking white hair of differing lengths across his different avatars. He has pale skin, wide upturned scarlet-red eyes paired with dark eye-bags, and a small mole under his left eye. Though rarely seen and not quite visible in his current outfits, Kuzuha also has a small mole on his right collarbone, and another one on his right arm. Being a vampire, Kuzuha has a pair of sharp pointed fangs, very long claw like fingernails, and pointed ears that have multiple piercings. Kuzuha has been seen wearing multiple differently-styled clothes.</p>
        <p>In his current outfit, Kuzuha has his not particularly styled mid-length white hair with a right-sweeping fringe. He wears a black zip-up turtleneck tracksuit with his signature red bat logo on the right side and a white stripe lining from his shoulders to his sleeves. The tracksuit has slits on the back near the waist so that his wings can open freely. Under it is a dark wine red sleeve length V-neck with a cross design on the neckline. He wears this ensemble either bare-foot or with lounge slippers, and with white wide-leg lounge pants that are slightly longer than his legs.</p>
        <br>
